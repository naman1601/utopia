# Utopia

Welcome to Utopia. This is a small project to try and figure out what would happen if we purged the bottom $x$% of the population (ranked by IQ) every time we hit some fixed population count.

Please feel free to tweak the values on your own and experiment.
Any suggestions to improve this/ideas about this or interesting observations are most welcome!
